This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack game. The game is played between the user and the computer, and the objective is to get a score as close to 21 as possible without going over. The code uses the random module to simulate a deck of cards and the replit module to clear the console screen.

The game starts by dealing two cards to both the user and the computer. The user can then choose to take more cards until they either reach 21 or decide to pass. The computer then takes its turn, and the winner is determined by comparing the final scores of both the user and the computer.

The code has error handling for certain edge cases such as when a player's score exceeds 21 or when both the user and the computer have the same score.

Overall, the code is well structured and easy to follow. However, it could be improved by adding more features such as the ability to bet on the outcome of the game or by adding more options for the user to choose from.
