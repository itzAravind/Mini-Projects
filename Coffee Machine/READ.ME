This is a simple coffee machine program that allows the user to select from three types of coffee (espresso, latte, and cappuccino) and processes their payment using various coins. The program checks whether the coffee can be made based on the availability of the required ingredients and processes the payment by checking whether the user has inserted enough money to cover the cost of the coffee.

If the user has inserted enough money, the program makes the coffee and updates the profit and resource values accordingly. If the user has not inserted enough money, the program refunds their money. The program also provides a report of the current resource levels and profit upon request by the user.

The program runs on a while loop until the user enters "off" to turn it off.

To expand this program into a bigger project, we could add more features and functionality. For example:

User authentication: Add a login system to the program to track the user's orders and preferences. The user could create an account with their favorite coffee options and payment details, making the ordering process faster and more convenient.

Payment options: Allow the user to pay for their coffee using various payment methods such as credit card, PayPal, or mobile payments.

Customization options: Allow the user to customize their coffee with various options such as size, sweetness level, and temperature.

Inventory management: Add a feature to automatically reorder resources when they run low, or alert the user when they need to restock certain items.

Sales analysis: Add a feature to track sales data and analyze trends over time. This could help the business owner make better decisions about pricing, inventory, and marketing.

Loyalty programs: Add a feature to reward loyal customers with discounts or free coffee after a certain number of orders.

By adding these features, we can turn a simple coffee machine program into a comprehensive coffee shop management system that can help streamline operations, increase sales, and improve customer satisfaction.
