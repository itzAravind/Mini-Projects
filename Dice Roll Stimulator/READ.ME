The program is built in Python and allows the user to specify the number of dice they want to roll and the number of sides on each die. The program then uses the built-in random module in Python to simulate the roll of each die. It generates a random number between 1 and the number of sides on the die specified by the user.

After rolling all the dice, the program outputs the result, which is the sum of all the rolls. For example, if the user rolls 2 dice with 6 sides each, the program will generate two random numbers between 1 and 6 and output their sum.

The user can run the program from the command line by typing python dice_roll.py and following the prompts to enter the number of dice and the number of sides on each die. The program then rolls the dice and outputs the result.
